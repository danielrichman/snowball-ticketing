Dear {{ recipient.name }},

{% rewrap %}
I am sorry to let you know that we will not be offer you any tickets for your waiting list places for the Snowball this year.

As it is so close to the ball, we have decided to freeze the refunding and sale of new tickets. You may however be able to get a ticket via a name change - we would suggest that you post on the Snowball 2013 Facebook page to see if there are any people offering to sell. The deadline for name changes will be 18:00 (6:00pm) this evening (05 Dec 2013).

Apologies once more and we hope to see you at next year's ball.

Thanks,
Snowball Ticketing
