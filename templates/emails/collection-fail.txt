Dear {{ recipient.name }},

{% rewrap %}
Our system indicates that you have not yet collected your tickets. In order to resolve this, we have several solutions:

 - If you are a Selwynite, we have put your ticket in your pigeon hole.

 - If you are not a Selwynite but know someone at Selwyn, let us know if you would like us to drop it off in that person's pigeon hole.

 - If you are in Cambridge on Friday afternoon, we will hold a fourth collection time from 16:15 until 18:00 just outside the Porters' Lodge

 - Otherwise, you will be able to pick your ticket up on the door.

Please contact ticketing@selwynsnowball.co.uk if you have any issues with this.

Thanks,
Snowball Ticketing
