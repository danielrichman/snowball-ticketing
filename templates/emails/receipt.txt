{#- The blank lines are very fiddly below.
    Basically there's a gap before the paid tickets, and then each optional
    section is responsible for adding a blank line after itself.
    In most cases this is the blank line between "endfor %} and {% endif" -#}
{#- We can't use url_for, since it works out external urls using the request
    environment. -#}

Our records show that you have not yet paid for some or all of your tickets.
If we do not receive this payment before 
{{ payment_deadline|format_datetime("date nice") }}
your tickets (or VIP upgrades, where appropriate) will be freed and given to
people currently on the waiting list.

Details of the amount owed and how to pay are outlined towards the end of
this email. Please be aware that it may take a few days for our system to
process your payment - when the payment is processed successfully, you will
receive a confirmation email. If you feel there is a problem or foresee a
problem arising, please do not hesitate to contact
ticketing@selwynsnowball.co.uk.

We are pleased to say that some tickets have been made available for our
ball this year, and as you have expressed interest by joining our waiting
list we are offering you the opportunity to buy them.

Assuming you still want this ticket, please pay within
{{ ask_pay_within }} {{ "day"|plural("ask_pay_within") }} (see below),
otherwise we will release it to others on the list.

If you know that you no longer require a ticket for the Snowball, please let
us know as soon as possible so that we can pass it on to someone else.
