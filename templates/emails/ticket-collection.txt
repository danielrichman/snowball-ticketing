Dear {{ recipient.name }},

Thank you for paying for your Snowball ticket. We hope you are looking
forward to the ball as much as we are.

We are planning to distribute physical tickets to the ball this week.
{%- if alumnus %}
We will also provide a desk on the night of the ball for alumni to
collect their tickets.

{% endrewrap %}

The details of the collection times are as follows:

Monday 2nd, 18:15 - 20:00; Tower Room, Selwyn College

In order to collect the tickets, we will require photo ID

These are the tickets you will be able to collect:
{% for ticket in paid_tickets -%}
    {#- #}    {{ "VIP" if ticket.vip else 'Standard' }}: {{ ticket.othernames }} {{ ticket.surname }}
{% endfor %}

If there are any problems with these names please let us know as soon as
possible, otherwise you may incur an administrative charge for name changing.
On the night, we will operate on the policy that if the name on the ticket
does not match the name on your ID, you will denied entry.

PLEASE NOTE:
We can only distribute orders of 2 or more tickets to the primary ticket
holder (i.e., the person who signs onto the ticketing website).
If you forsee there being a problem with this, please contact
